## List of scripts

`understandParameters.R`
Script to explore the influence of key parameters such as speciation and extinction rates, Brownian motion, trait optima, selection strength and transition rates between discrete states. Do not use the output for trait imputation!

`simContTraits.R`
This simulates continuous traits along a phylogeny according to Brownian motion. 

`SimData.R`
This simulates continuous, discrete traits along a phylogeny according to several models as Brownian motion, OU and MK.

`NAImputation.R`
This simulates NaNs according to 3 concepts of missing data (MCRA, MAR and MNAR) and incomplete phylogenetic trees.
